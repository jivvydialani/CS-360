### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

  I was tasked to design a mobile application to address the user's need for a simple and efficient way to track their daily weight and progress toward their goal weight. It aims to provide a user-friendly interface for logging daily weight, setting a goal weight, and receiving notifications when their goal weight is achieved. The app was intended to cater to users with a variety of health and fitness goals, including weight loss, maintenance, and tracking for medical reasons.

### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

To support user needs and create a user-centered UI for the app, I had to develop several screen and implement some functionality. I started with a Login/Register screen, which is essential for user authentication and account creating. Next, I designed and developed the Dashboard to display daily weights with dates, and button for weight entry, edit entry, and goal setting. 

----
### How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

  A lot of googling and help from the professor allowed me to overcome any roadblocks. I initially wanted to use a vector for the project. However, after reading advice from the professor, the best approach to this project would be to use a Binary Search Tree. This is because the elements being stored a university courses, and the functions most used are searching and printing. A BST is the most efficient ADT to use in this scenario.

----
### How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

  A lot more in depth analysis on how to produce efficient software. In my early programming courses, I would write code that was easy to write and understand. The complexity of the code I have to write does not matter to the end user; it is the speed and efficiency of the program.

----
### Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

Writing a recursive program was really interesting to learn. It took me a little longer to read and figure out, but it is more maintable and adaptable in the long run.

### In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

Writing a recursive program was really interesting to learn. It took me a little longer to read and figure out, but it is more maintable and adaptable in the long run.
